I have, finally, after four years, begun writing again to post online. I decided to
do away with medium or what have you and post on github instead. I moved away from an
amazing React-built portfolio website to a simple one built with Hugo (check it out,
it is really powerful, and perfect for this kind of website).

Over the past four years, I never felt like I needed to write. I didn't forget the
craft of writing, or become illiterate - I just never felt the desire to sit in front
of a computer and write. What would I write about? What was even there for me to
write? What could I write that someone could not write _better_?

Anyway, after a lot of prodding and convincing that the last point was untrue from
multiple people, I have decided to use this website as a place to post stuff that I
think about and write. Whether the stuff is useful is a moot point. All that matters
is that _it is_.

## Hello (Again)

So what happened in these four years? I got a job, got married, got promoted, and got
to realize that there is so much I do not know. The last part might be a cliche, but
something about working on something very niche and specialized is an experience in
humility on its own.

You see, there are problems that are hard, and there are problems that _look hard_.
The difference between the two is that solving a problem that is hard makes you
humble. Solving a problem that only looks hard, and realizing that it only looked
hard, makes you confident about the next problem (which might actually be hard).
Solving a problem that in reality only looked hard, but made you perceive it as
actually hard, leads to two outcomes. The better outcome is when you feel defeated
about your skills. The worse one, however, is when you feel cocksure.

Wait, that's a lose-lose situation! Not necessarily, if you can handle the defeatist
tendencies that all software engineers have (Yeah, don't lie to me. I know you
sometimes think if you should even be here). The feeling of defeat makes you humble.
The humility, if developed, translates into maturity. Maturity, then translates into
good leadership.

And this lead to me thinking - how do I become more mature? I know the frontal cortex
doesn't really mature until I am about 30. And more importantly, how do I become a
good leader?

For what it's worth, becoming a manager is not where I see myself. The job role does
not sit well with my lone-wolf work style, nor do I feel my sarcastic humor will be
taken well by a subordinate. I am lucky that leadership is multi-faceted, and that
I don't really need to consider that path as a leader. I can exert influence my own
way.

And this blog is a means for that. The first person I need to infuence is me.
Influencing others will follow.

## What will I write about?

Honestly, IDK. My first idea for the "tech blog" section of this is my `tmux`
configuration. I am yet to find inspiration for the "non-tech" section of the
blog. Should I write down what I find interesting at work? Or do I write about how
I grow as a leader, when the opportunities arise, like a LinkedIn post without the
cringeworthy language and self-pats? TBH, I might repost some stories from here into
social media as well.

Maybe I'll write stuff on choosing your career, and on development, and what have you.
Maybe I'll write stuff on life outside your career.

There are a couple of maybes in the above paragraph. I never stopped writing per se,
I always kept saying "maybe I'll write". I removed the "maybe" and finally wrote
this post. Kinda sounds like Yoda -  "Do or do not. There is no try".
Or as I say to myself during times of heavy work - "Do. There is no do not. There is
no try."

A junior engineer once pointed out that it made me look like a strict mentor when I
said it. I like to think of it differently - Just do. You have something to do, do it.
Even if it is bad at first - do it. Even if all you manage to do is 1%, do it. It is
better than giving in to your anxieties and not doing it.

I think I found the idea for my next post. Anxiety. Or, anxiety as I've experienced
it.

> _I originally thought of writing my experiences dealing with anxiety with this
post, but  I felt it would spaghettify this introduction. It's best to keep these
bite-sized. I am not writing a book (yet)._
