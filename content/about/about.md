## What's this site for?

I have decided to consolidate my portfolio (which is linked to my github
account) and my future blogs.

A more detailed introduction is [here](/personal_blog/hello_world/).

This space shall contain feed-like updates that may not pertain to individual
posts. Or it might change to something else. That's the flexibility of having
a personal website as your blog :)
